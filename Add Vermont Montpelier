Dear Mayor Watson City Council Members:
My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Montpelier. While I applaud Mayor Watsonâ€™s commitment to review and reform police use of force policies, I donâ€™t believe this is enough. Police reforms do not necessarily eliminate police violence; the Minneapolis Police Department had already implemented many reforms, and George Floyd was still murdered. I urge that you take radical steps to defund the police and move towards the goal of reimagining public safety without a police department.
I am writing to demand that the 2020-2021 Montpelier municipal budget be revised to reallocate funds away from police and towards education, healthcare infrastructure (including non-coercive mental healthcare), youth programming, and non-coercive drug and alcohol treatment programming.
Mayor Watson and city councilors, please consider making these changes that are in the best interest of our community now and for the future.
Thank you,
[YOUR NAME] [YOUR ADDRESS] [YOUR PHONE] [YOUR EMAIL]
